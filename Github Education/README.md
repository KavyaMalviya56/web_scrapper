# Github Education Event Scraper and Notifier

## Overview

This Python script scrapes events information from a github education, stores it in a MongoDB database, and periodically checks for new events. When new events are found, it sends notifications to a specified endpoint. This README provides instructions for setting up and using the script.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` package manager
- MongoDB (running locally or on a remote server)
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
